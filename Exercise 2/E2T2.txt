Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy allow full access to resources, this does not follow the rule of least privilege.
2. The load balancer is not set up to switch HTTP requests from non-SSL to SSL (HTTPS).
3. Port 5000 is easily connect from public IP internet.
4. S3 buckets turn off serverside encryption and logging.
5. AWS System Manager should strictly control EC2 instance.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Should set IAM policy to readonly.
2. Loadbalancer should limit the traffic.
3. Decrease risks by removing unnecessary port in EC2 instance.
4. S3 buckets turn on Logging.
