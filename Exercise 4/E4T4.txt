# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

--- I think there are two approach. First, we can prevent by disabling ssh access. Second, using AWS Systems Manager to login that helps to remove external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

--- Unauthorized access cannot be stopped by setting up private endpoints in the VPC for S3 bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

--- No, Applying default encryption will not effect the encryption of files in S3 buckets.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

--- The next cloud formation stack deployment will change if something adjusts.
